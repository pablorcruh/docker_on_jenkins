## Jenkins Image 

This is a Custom Image from Jenkins Official 
we install:

* Docker
* Docker-compose
* Heroku-cli
* System Update

The purpose of this image is to help us setup a 
Jenkins Integration Server so we can use docker as
part of our pipeline.

We use this image as part of another project where
we automate the all deployment on Digital Ocean 
of the server using terraform.
